# TTS-Energy-Well
Lotus's energy Counters are a simple and elegant solution for handling large amounts of attached energy cards while keeping them visible to players. The counter acts as a bag that takes in energy and turns them into icons that sit below the card, which can then be clicked to retrieve the energy easily.

The Energy Counters now have different card art for every type of energy that exists, with each icon now referring to an energy card rather than an energy provided for easier use of energy removal cards and fewer confusing interactions. New features include the ability to drag the icons directly out of the well and drop them as cards, a better position for removed cards when icons are clicked and a new all button that can empty the Counter in 1 click (or drag).
